# funsciencewithyourcomputer
Transform small computer programs to do practical and fun scientific experiments

This project contains the original book [Fun Science With Your Computer](./funsciencewithyourcomputer.pdf) and the code for each of its activities and exercises - Pseudo Random, Monte Carlo, Random Walk, Translation, Launch, Path Finder, Slow or Fast, Space Simulation, Web Browser, Vector Graphics, Chess. Phew, imagine that.

If you're grade 6 or higher, if you're a teacher, go read the welcome note at [Fun Science With Your Computer](./funsciencewithyourcomputer.pdf) and give it a try...

I - Christophe Cornu - originally authored and published these materials as an EBook on July 2007. I now make these materials available on GitHub.
